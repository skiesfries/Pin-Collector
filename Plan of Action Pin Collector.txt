Pin Collector 1.0

-can now successfully add pins and save them to the view all pins menu,
after adding multiple pins you can view them all in the order they were added, from the main menu.

TODO:

-Edit/Delete Pin from Pin List

-after user is told pin is saved, it should ask them to press space to add another pin or enter to return 
to the main menu.

-Need to be able to reorganize list by name, collection, character.
